# LLM Demonstartion using FOSS models

- The main motto of this is to demonstrate the use of Free open source LLM models and not to validate the model accuracy
- For testing purpose I used the t5 large model which is of 13B parameters

- I will further try to update this project with more features and try to use different libraries for all the task instead of Langchain


PS: To test this application follow the below steps:

- pip install -r requirements.txt
